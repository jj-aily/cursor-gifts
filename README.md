# House Rules
For your first contribution, please create a directory at the top level using your GitHub id as the name of the folder.  This
will help others discover who is the owner of what is underneath.  Within that directory, you are encouraged to create a
subdirectory for every individual idea that you present.  

In general, the ideas are not meant to span too many files and technologies as the basic idea is to provide snackable content
that anyone can follow in minutes and certainly not over multiple hours.

For each idea, you are also strongly encouraged to add a README.md that explains the problem you are trying to solve.
